# Chess Rule's
The goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent’s king. This means the king is under threat of capture and cannot escape.
# Game Setup
1. Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, and 8 Pawns.
2. The board has 64 squares, arranged in an 8×8 grid.
3. White always moves first.
# How Each Piece Move's
1. king(K)
   * Moves one square in any direction.
   * Cannot move into check.
   * Special move: Castling.
2. Queen(Q)
   * Moves any number of squares and captures in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
3. Rook(R)
   * moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
   * particpates in castling
4. Bishop(B)
   * Moves diagonally any number of squares.
5. Knight(N)
   * Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular.
   * Can jump over other pieces.
6. Pawn(P)
   * Moves forward one square (or two from its starting position).
   * Captures diagonally.
   * Special moves:
      * En passant: Capture a pawn that has just moved two squares forward, as if it had moved only one.
      * Promotion: When a pawn reaches the opposite end, it must be promoted (usually to a queen).
# Special Rules
1. Castling
   * A one-time move involving the king and a rook.
   * Conditions:
     * Neither piece has moved.
     * No pieces between the king and rook.
     * The king is not in, through, or into check.
   * King moves two squares toward the rook, rook jumps over the king.
2. Pawn Pronotion
   * When a pawn reaches the opposite rank (8th for white, 1st for black), it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or
     Knight (usually a Queen).
3. Check and Checkmate
   * Check: King is under attack.
   * Checkmate: King is in check and cannot escape = game over.
   * You must move out of check; you cannot leave your king in check.
4. Stalemate and Draws
   * Stalemate: A player has no legal moves, but is not in check = draw.
   * Other draws:
     * Agreement between players.
     * Insufficient material to checkmate.
     * 50-move rule: no pawn movement or captures in 50 moves.
     * Threefold repetition: same position appears 3 times.
